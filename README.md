# star-control-guide-maps

This repository contains code used to generate resources for a 
[walkthrough](https://wiki.uqm.stack.nl/Main_Page) for the PC game Star Control 2 and its modern port the Ur-Quan Masters. 
This is a space based game which involves exploring stars and planets. Two 
important resources in the game are minerals and biological life. This 
repository generates maps of the density of both for the walkthrough


The `data_extract` folder contains the code used to extract data from 
the game. The `generate_maps` folder contains python scripts for generating
the resource maps.
